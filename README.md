🐍 Python Learning & Practice Repository

This repository documents my Python learning journey through hands-on coding.
It contains well-organized Python programs covering core language concepts,
problem-solving exercises, and small utilities.

📌 Topics Covered:
- Python Basics (syntax, variables, data types)
- Control Flow (if-else, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Data Structures (list, tuple, set, dictionary)
- File Handling
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Practice problems and examples

🎯 Purpose:
- Build strong Python fundamentals
- Practice clean and readable code
- Serve as a reference for future projects

🚀 This repository will be continuously updated as I progress further in Python.
